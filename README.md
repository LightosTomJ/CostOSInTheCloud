# CostOS Web Estimating Service

This is a temporary repository .NET Core 3 of Nomitech CostOS estimating software. The purpose of this project is to convert the desktop edition to a full-stack microservice architectural solution, with REST API access benefiting from the .NET Core 3's language agnostic features.

The addition of machine learning framework (ML.Net) will be able to integrate immediately with these features.

The user interface (UI) is using Microsoft ASP.Net "Blazor" module.
