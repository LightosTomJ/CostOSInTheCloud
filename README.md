# CostOSInTheCloud
This is a temporary repository .NET Core 3 of Nomitech CostOS estimating software. The purpose of this project is to convert the desktop edition into a full microservice architectural solution, with REST API access benefiting from the .NET Core 3's language agnostic feature.  With the addition of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the new framework will be able to integrate immediately with these features.
